# Hi-lo Multiplayer using TCP sockets

This is a basic implementation of a Hi-Lo game, where you can connect multiple clients together and play a game of Hi-Lo.

## How does it work ?

One Server can host a match between many clients, one client creates a lobby and the others join that lobby;

Every client can make a guess;

The game only progresses when everyone tries to guess;

Win the game by getting guessing the secret number faster then you opponents.
